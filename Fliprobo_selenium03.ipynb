       "[\"If you want the absolute best when it comes to performance, then the Alienware Area 51M should be on top of your list. It is essentially a desktop replacement that leaves no stones unturned when it comes to delivering pure performance for gaming. It's basically a desktop in disguise, featuring up to 10th gen Intel Core i9K processors and Nvidia RTX 20-series GPU. It's worth pointing out that Area 51M is not exactly suitable for carrying around often. It's a desktop replacement that can be moved around but it's best to set it on a desk. All the variants feature a 71.1-inch display and you can configure it with panels that offer up to 4K resolution.\",\n",
       " \"If the Area 51M is a bit too much for you then you might want to check out the Alienware m15 R3. It's a more portable offering from the folks over at Alienware but it still packs the punch to deliver solid performance. The company hasn't updated these laptops in India with the latest 11th gen Intel Core processors, but a refresh is due anytime now. In fact, Alienware has also launched a Ryzen edition in the global market, so you might want to check it out before dropping big money on this laptop.\",\n",
       " \"When the ASUS ROG Strix Scar 15 ended up on our test bench, we immediately knew it was overkill. But you know what? It's a good kind of overkill. ASUS' annual upgrade to the Scar lineup saw some significant changes this year and we like most of them. The Asus ROG Strix Scar 15 comes with up to AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. The laptop also features per-key RGB on its opto-mechanical keyboard. The new Scar laptops also have a slightly new design, making them look a little different from the older ones. It's also worth pointing out that the laptop comes with a 15.6-inch 1440p display with a refresh rate of 165Hz.\",\n",
       " 'The Asus Zephyrus G14 is a first-of-its-kind gaming laptop, featuring a high-power 8-core CPU in a 14-inch chassis. Powered by the AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors going all the way up to Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, the AMD Zephyrus G14 is a perfect laptop for those kinds of people who like to game and create, but put a priority on doing so using a light-weight machine.',\n",
       " \"Lenovo's Legion 5i is also a suitable laptop for most people as it packs a 10th gen Intel Core i5 or an i7 processor with up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU. You get a 15.6-inch display with this laptop and there's support for up to 144Hz as well. If you want a bigger screen size, then you might want to check out the Lenovo Legion 7i which also comes with slightly better internals for improved performance.\",\n",
       " 'The machine is powered by an Intel Core i7-10875H processor, offering 8 cores and 16 threads. So, you can leave behind all your concerns around the CPU bottlenecking the overall performance during gaming. With an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Max-Q, this laptop can manage pretty much anything game you throw at it and then some more. The star of the show however is the awesome 300Hz refresh rate capable, 1080p IPS panel on this gaming laptop. Yes, you read that correctly, 300Hz, which means you can get silky smooth, brag-worthy 300FPS on e-sports centric games on this machine.',\n",
       " 'The Acer Aspire 7 gaming laptop is a very capable laptop that has made it to a lot of our recommendation lists. It costs less than Rs 60,000 but it packs a decent set of internals that should be enough to handle your gaming needs. The laptop even managed to run a lot of modern AAA titles without any issues even though it only has a GTX 1650 GPU. The Ryzen 5 5500U processor inside this laptop runs the show flawlessly. It also has a really good battery life, something that often goes missing when it comes to gaming laptops. You can check out our review of the laptop right here.']"

       " \"I  invested in Tesla back in 2013, I was very much a bear. My reasoning was simple: Tesla was trying to do what no American automaker had done so far: Develop and sell a mass-market electric vehicle. It was trying to do what no American company had done in nearly a century: Start up a successful new auto manufacturing business. To take it a step further, I bought 40 shares from Tesla miners, investing about $1,800 in total with part of the proceeds from a 401(k) rollover. At the $908 per share price I sold at, that's a realized profit of almost $35,000! It's may not be life-changing money, but it's an incredible return nonetheless ,Now i am working with 3 asset Gold silver and crypto  all are good , but Crypto  Investment is the mother of them all , Crypto has followed this pattern for sometime now; It dips and gets everyone scared then after retesting an old resistance several times, we wake up one day to see it is bullish. This period is the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. I'd strongly advise any newbie/traders to buy the dip for traders who are still wondering whether to enter the market or old time traders who are Holders to seek help from not just any trader but an established trading expert with at least 89% trade accuracy. I underwent a series of trading losses I'd best not talk about before I was introduced to trading analyst Mr Tommy Harrison  My contact with him has been the Hallmark of this year for me, under his careful guide and his signal service I've been able to recover my losses and even grow my trading portfolio massively from 1.2 btc to 4.6 btc in just 5 weeks. I will advise traders esp newbies to have an orientation of trading before they get involved in it. Mr Tommy makes you learn daily while you make profit with his signals.

What if you can write code that upon your stop loss sale, you place a limit order to buy back at the sale price? And then on the upside, you set a trailing stop loss (and if the trailing stop loss gets hit, you’d also place a limit order to rebuy the stock at the stop loss price) This strategy essentially limits your downside and lets you participate more fully on the upside, and takes the “art” out of guessing the optimal stop loss and take profit price levels.

I can confirm it provides an ok depth of alg trading to the audiences who have no knowledge of alg trading. But seriously it would be great if the presenter is able to introduce some more trading algorithms even though just conceptually. I personally feel the presenter focuses too much on the implementation itself and most of the content is to demonstrate how to gather data from idx cloud. I know getting data is crucial but it has very little to do with trading. I don't see the point repeating data collection in all of the three projects. Overall, it is good but not great.
